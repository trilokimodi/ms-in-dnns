# Lecture F: Project proposal and normalizing flows

- The normalizing flow we discussed in the lecture is based on [this](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial11/NF_image_modeling.html) tutorial.
- A PyTorch implementation of RealNVP, the flow on which our model is based, is available e.g. [here](https://github.com/chrischute/real-nvp/tree/master).
- The [RealNVP Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803) discusses the training setup and model architecture in detail.
